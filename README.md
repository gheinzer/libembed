# libembed, a C++17 library for embedded devices
`libembed` is a library including various utilities, HALs, BSPs and drivers. It is supposed to provide a user-friendly, standardized interface for easy use with C++ and PlatformIO.

Note that this library may not always be ideal from a performance or memory standpoint; it is mainly designed for quick installation and usage. I'm happy to hear your about the possible improvements with this
library.

For the API documentation, please refer to [the auto-generated docs](https://gheinzer.github.io/libembed/) on GitHub Pages.
